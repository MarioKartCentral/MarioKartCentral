# MarioKartCentral Documentation

Welcome to the MarioKartCentral documentation! This documentation provides detailed information about the system's architecture, implementation, and key concepts.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several key documents that cover different aspects of the system:

- [Developer Onboarding](onboarding.md) - Getting started with the development environment
- [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) - High-level system architecture and deployment patterns
- [Backend Architecture](backend.md) - Detailed backend implementation and design patterns
- [Frontend Architecture](frontend.md) - Detailed frontend implementation and design patterns
- [Authentication & Authorization](auth.md) - User authentication and permission system
- [Database Schema](database.md) - Database design and data organization
- [Internationalization](internationalization.md) - Multi-language support implementation

## Recommended Reading Order

1. If you're new to the project, start with the [Developer Onboarding](onboarding.md) guide.
2. Continue with the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to understand the high-level system components and how they interact.
3. Read the [Database Schema](database.md) documentation to understand how data is organized and stored.
4. Continue with [Backend Architecture](backend.md) and [Frontend Architecture](frontend.md) to learn about the implementation patterns and code organization.
5. Finally, dive into [Authentication & Authorization](auth.md) for details about the security model and permission system.
6. If you're working with translations or multi-language features, read the [Internationalization](internationalization.md) guide.
