<p class="text-lg">These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of MKCentral ("the site," "we," "us," "our"). MKCentral is a non-profit, community-run platform providing services for the Mario Kart community. By using MKCentral, you agree to these Terms in their entirety.</p>

## User Eligibility

To protect the integrity of the platform, MKCentral reserves the right to retain certain information related to deleted accounts for purposes such as fraud prevention, enforcing bans, or detecting users attempting to circumvent restrictions. This includes data reasonably necessary to uphold the security and fairness of our services.
