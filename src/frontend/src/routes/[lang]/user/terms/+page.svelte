      These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of MKCentral ("the site," "we," "us," "our"). MKCentral
      is a non-profit, community-run platform providing services for the Mario Kart community. By using MKCentral, you
      agree to these Terms in their entirety.

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">User Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        MKCentral and its community are only available to users who are at least 13 years old. By registering for
        MKCentral, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Account Rules</h2>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300 mb-2">Single Account Policy</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        You may only create and maintain one account on MKCentral. Creating multiple accounts ("alting") is prohibited
        and will result in the permanent banning of all alternate accounts. Your primary account may also be temporarily
        or permanently banned at the discretion of MKCentral staff.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300 mb-2">Account Deletion and Cooling-Off Period</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        If you request your account to be deleted, you may not create another account for one year following that
        deletion. Any accounts created within one year of deletion will be removed or banned.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300 mb-2">Account Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        To protect the integrity of the platform, MKCentral reserves the right to retain certain information related to
        deleted accounts for purposes such as fraud prevention, enforcing bans, or detecting users attempting to
        circumvent restrictions. This includes data reasonably necessary to uphold the security and fairness of our
        services.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300 mb-2">User-Generated Content</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The providers of MKCentral are not responsible for any user-generated content, events, or accounts. Content

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300 mb-2">Independent Organization</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        MKCentral provides tools for users to organize and participate in Mario Kart tournaments. These tournaments are

        by tournament organizers or participants during such events.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-300 mb-2">No Endorsement</h3>
      <p>
        MKCentral does not endorse any specific tournament or organizer. Participation in tournaments hosted through
        MKCentral is at your own risk. Organizers are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable guidelines
        or terms set by Nintendo or other third parties.
