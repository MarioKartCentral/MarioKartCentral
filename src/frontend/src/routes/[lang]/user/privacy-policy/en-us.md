We use a limited number of cookies that are essential for the core functionality and security of the site. These cookies serve purposes such as:

- Remembering your language preference.
- Maintaining your login session.
- Assisting in the detection and prevention of fraudulent or abusive behavior.

These cookies are strictly necessary for the operation and integrity of the site and its security features. They are not used for advertising or third-party analytics, and therefore an opt-out option is not provided as they are required for the site to function.

You may request deletion of your account and associated personal data. However, please be aware that MKCentral reserves the right to retain certain information after account deletion for specific, necessary purposes.

This retained information includes data required to detect and prevent fraud, enforce bans, and identify users attempting to circumvent restrictions, which is essential for platform security and community integrity.

Additionally, we retain certain tournament or registry data to maintain historical accuracy and event records, as this data is part of the shared community content and history hosted on the platform.

## Third-Party Services

We utilize trusted third-party service providers for essential infrastructure and technical operations, such as hosting and monitoring, which are necessary to operate MKCentral. These providers may process technical data as part of the services they render to us.
